# About This Document

#### Usage
This document contains videos and articles about different aspects of C++ programming. Best way to learn from them is to try them yourself, or in case of a lecture, read some more about this topic in C++ documentation. 

#### Advanced topics
You should not proceed to the topics after [C++ STL](https://github.com/RedSkittleFox/cpp-learning-resources#c-stl) without knowing the basics of C++ (or completing at least one series from [Basics Of C++](https://github.com/RedSkittleFox/cpp-learning-resources#basics-of-c) category). The content following [C++ STL](https://github.com/RedSkittleFox/cpp-learning-resources#c-stl) isn't sorted by the difficulity, everything there is considered advanced C++. You should be able to understand most of that and apply it in real world after compeling [Basics Of C++](https://github.com/RedSkittleFox/cpp-learning-resources#basics-of-c) category. 

#### Purpose
This place is mostly targeted for people with basic C++ and STL knowledge. It's supposed to improve your code's readibility,  performance and make your code more compact by using STL features.

#### Contributing
Create either an [issue](https://github.com/RedSkittleFox/cpp-learning-resources/issues) with title and link to the resource you would like to add to this document or create new branch, add some changes and create a pull request. 

#### Comments and suggestions
Please leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions via [Issues](https://github.com/RedSkittleFox/cpp-learning-resources/issues).
