# About This Document

#### Usage
This document contains videos and articles about different aspects of C++ programming. The best way to learn from them is to try them out yourself, or in the case of a lecture, do private research and experiments regarding the topic. 

#### Advanced topics
You should not proceed to the topics after [C++ STL](https://github.com/RedSkittleFox/cpp-learning-resources#c-stl) without knowing the basics of C++ (or completing at least one series from [Basics Of C++](https://github.com/RedSkittleFox/cpp-learning-resources#basics-of-c) category). The content following [C++ STL](https://github.com/RedSkittleFox/cpp-learning-resources#c-stl) isn't sorted by the difficulity, everything there is considered advanced C++. You should be able to understand most of it and apply it in your code after completing [Basics Of C++](https://github.com/RedSkittleFox/cpp-learning-resources#basics-of-c) category. 

#### Purpose
This document is a collection of high quality c++ learning materials for both new and experienced c++ programmers.

#### Contributing
Create either an [issue](https://github.com/RedSkittleFox/cpp-learning-resources/issues) with title and link to the resource you would like to add to this document or create new branch, add some changes and create a pull request. 

#### Comments and suggestions
Please leave your comments, thoughts and suggestions via [Issues](https://github.com/RedSkittleFox/cpp-learning-resources/issues).
